The fill command takes two points as arguments. It will
replace every block in between the two points with the block
given as last argument.

By giving a -b after the command name, you can define a
point and the size you want.

Usage: /fill x1,y1,z1 x2,y2,z2 block
       /fill -b x,y,z width,height,depth block
